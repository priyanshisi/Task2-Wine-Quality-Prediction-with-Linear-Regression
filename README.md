# Task2-Wine-Quality-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning model built using linear regression to predict the quality of wine based on certain features. Linear regression is a popular technique for regression problems where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable.
**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality Dataset which consists of various chemical properties of wines along with their quality ratings. It has been preprocessed and cleaned for this project.
**Dependencies**
This project uses Python and the following libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```

**Model**
The model is built using a linear regression algorithm. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. In this case, we're trying to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

**Files**
wine_quality_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
'winequality-red123.csv': The dataset used for training and testing.
